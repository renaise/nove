## Landing Page Strategy (Vite + React)

The landing page appeals to emotional needs—aspirational copy about freedom and joy, not feature lists.

### Structure
1. **Hero** — Aspirational opening with primary CTA
2. **How It Works** — The four-screen journey, simplified
3. **Trust & Social Proof** — Testimonials, boutique logos, privacy assurance
4. **Final CTA** — Warm invitation to start

### CTAs
- **Primary:** "Start Your Joyful Discovery" (Blush button, top-right)
- **Secondary:** "See Our Boutique Partners" (Link, supporting trust)

### Trust Elements

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Testimonials** | "Novia turned my panic into pure joy. I walked into the boutique feeling so confident!" |
| **Boutique Logos** | "Trusted by the Finest Boutiques: We're making fittings better for everyone." |
| **Core Statistic** | "47 Dresses Tested. 1 Dream Found. Start your effortless journey now." |
